STEP 4: SELECT YOUR USB FLASH DRIVE AND NAVIGATE TO YOUR DOWNLOADS FOLDER AND SELECT JERMAOS.ISO FOR THE BOOT SELECTION

STEP 5: KEEP ALL OTHER SETTINGS AT DEFAULT AND CLICK ON START

STEP 6: (MOST SYSTEMS ALREADY HAVE USB BOOT SET ON AS DEFAULT BUT IF NOT GO INTO YOUR BIOS AND MOVE IT UP ABOVE YOUR NORMAL BOOT DRIVE)

GO TO: https://www.disk-image.com/faq-bootmenu.htm AND LEARN WHAT KEY YOUR PC MANUFACTURER HAS SET TO THE BOOT KEY

HIT THAT KEY AND SELECT YOUR USB DRIVE FOR INSTALLATIONS

METHOD 2: DISK DRIVE

FOR THIS TO WORK YOU WILL NEED 2 THINGS A DVD WRITER INSTALLED INTO YOUR COMPUTER AND A BLANK DVD-R OR DVD-RW DISK

STEP 1: DOWNLOAD THE ISO FROM RELEASES

STEP 2: INSERT A BLANK DVD INTO YOUR DVD DRIVE

STEP 3: NAVIGATE TO YOUR DOWNLOAD FOLDER AND RIGHT CLICK ON THE FILE AND SELECT BURN DISK IMAGE
